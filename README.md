# 1. Building Generative AI Workflows with Amazon Bedrock

This project covers the development of an AI-powered support system using Amazon Bedrock. It involves working with Bedrock’s core capabilities—prompt management, Prompt Flows, Bedrock Agents, Knowledge Bases, and foundational models—to build intelligent, context-aware workflows.

The system integrates Bedrock with AWS services such as Lambda for query categorization and Amazon RDS for storing embeddings and enabling efficient retrieval. Dynamic Prompt Flows are designed to adapt based on query intent and complexity, ensuring accurate and personalized responses.

A full support workflow is implemented, where Bedrock Agents handle user questions, provide information, and assist with tasks like infrastructure setup and troubleshooting.

Overall, the work demonstrates how LLMs, retrieval components, and serverless AWS infrastructure can be combined to create scalable, AI-driven applications.
